7:00 - 8:00 pm Peter Shannon - Docker at DramaFever

At DramaFever we have been running Docker in production since October 2013. In this talk, I will detail how DramaFever implemented Docker for our entire development pipeline from laptops to production. I’ll cover the pain points and failure scenarios we’ve encountered and how we’ve worked through them.
